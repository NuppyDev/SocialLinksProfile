## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow styles


### What I learned

More than anything, what I had to reinforce when doing this practice is the use of the FLEXBOX

```css
body{
    background-color: var(--Color-Grey-900);
    color: var(--Color-White);
    height: 100vh;
    justify-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

The areas that I may possibly focus on are styling, because I feel that I could improve more in that area.


### Useful resources

- [Desafío HTML + CSS — Parte 1: Mobile First](https://youtu.be/ERnGV1zvOJ0?si=dYnBxDv1IIMTGxib) - This helped me for the reason of how to start with development under Mobile-First. I really liked this pattern and will use it in the future.
